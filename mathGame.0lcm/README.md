# Math game

A basic console application that writes a math problem to the console and asks the user to solve it.  
Each game involves 5 different problems that are asked to, and solved by the user. Afterwards,
the game is recorded and the user can either return to the main menu, or continue playing with the same configurations.

# Features
This console application includes several features for better expereience including:  

* The ability to choose the gamemode as well as difficulty for more flexibility with each game.  
* A random gamemode that randomizes the type of problems presented to the user.  
* A log of past games including: dates, scores, difficulties, gamemodes, and time taken to complete each game.  
* A five game cap of recorded games in order to minimize wasted time and unnnecesary components when showing the user their past games, as well as ensuring the log is always up to date.  
* Difficulties ranging from easy, all the way up to hard.  
* And other minor details for functionality and ease of use.  

# How to use
Upon running the program, you will be prompted with a list of options you can take, and asked for input. Simply type in what option you want, and click enter.
The application will guide you through all the selection menus, providing you further ease of use. Any invalid inputs will get caught, and you will be reprompted.  

# tips
When using playing the game, after being prompted to answer the problem, only numbers are accepted (1, 2, 3). Words are not, even if they are the equivalent of a number (one, two, three). This is slightly inconvenient, and can be confusing if the application is telling you that "one" is not a number, however functionality for this kind of input hasn't been added yet.
